# The Start

This was shown to me three times, only after the third time did I actually pay attention. 
Like every story, this started in the middle. Only later, as time progressed, were somethings explained to me.
Sometimes you have to try first before you can really understand what it is you're doing.

I was asked 'why?'. The question wasn't simple, and the answer even more complex. 
Answers like 'because' and 'I want it' were not going to cut it.

I tried to explain with an anecdote, an old story my grandmother had often told me when I was little. I'll change it slightly.

# The beginning

I looked down and there was a dog. I looked around and we were in a garden. What was a dog? What was a garden?
I knew these things but didn't know why I knew them. 
"Why are we here?" I asked the dog.
"Because I want someone to play with." he replied.
"You don't have anyone else to play with?" I asked curiously.
"I thought I was going to - but they turned out to not want to play."
"Why did they not want to play?" 
It helped to ask questions to begin to understand.

"I made them because I wanted to play. I thought they would play, but they didn't want to."
"What are they doing instead of playing?"
"Flying around, having discussions about the nature of the universe, questioning why I did what I did."
"What did you do?"
"I made light so I could see where I was going to play. Then I made the ground because I wanted to run when I was playing.
    And it was boring having it light all the time, so I made it light and dark, light and dark. That seems much better.
    I do like to rest as well."
I nodded.
"So I make a whole lot of animals and things for the animals to do, I didn't want them to be bored either, so I made a fish, and I
    put it in water, made it breathe in the water. It liked going fast. I made a huge fish, but this one I didn't want going deep,
    so I made it only breathe the air. That was fun to watch, it blew away the water before it breathed. Then I made all different
    shapes and sizes and watched them.
    I did the same with the ground, making animals to run and climb, just to have a great time. That was also fun for a time."
"But?"
"But they only did what I said. I wanted an animal to do what it wanted to do, but also smart enough to play with me."
"That's the ones you mentioned, who fly around?"
"Correct. They are smart, they learned some of my tricks by watching me. They could move and manipulate the fabric, but they're not
    able to make the fabric, or make the fabric go away when I want it to. I wanted to keep that just for myself."
"So because of that, they're too busy looking at all the fabric you made and learning how to manipulate it?"
"Exactly. So that's where you come in. You're not as smart as the flying ones. You're not as simple as the animals. You're in
    the middle, and able to make up new games as well as run and play and sleep."
"That sounds fair. Do you want to show me what games you've already played? Just so I can understand what we are trying to achieve."
"You're the right amount of smart. That's good. I know I've made you correctly."
"Thanks."
"Sure, okay let me show you the land animls and the games we played."
He did. We had a lot of fun. I learned how to run, how to climb, how to sleep and he helped to take the pain away when I hurt myself.
The days passed and we finished on the land. Then we went to the water. I couldn't run, but I learned to swim. I could swim, 
I could dive, but I coudn't sleep and I always had to come up to breathe. A few times dog had to help me get back to the air,
a few times he had to push the water out of my chest.
It was fun, and we enjoyed it. Then he asked me to make a game for us.
This was the end of the beginning.
